        <li>To speed up the cooking process, slice the chicken breasts horizontally and lengthwise into thin cutlets.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the chicken with salt, ground black pepper, and seasoning of choice.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil or butter to the skillet when hot. Carefully place the chicken breasts in the skillet and cook for about 4 minutes on each side. The chicken is ready to serve when the inside is no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Wash and trim the green beans. Pat them dry with a paper towel (to avoid oil splatters).</li>
